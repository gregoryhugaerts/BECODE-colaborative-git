# Poem

In the twilight's hush, whispers take flight,
Beneath the stars' soft, guiding light,
A melody of dreams, woven in the night.
This poem is better than mine, 
In the ephemeral state of being in which i am at this point in time, I effervesce in the clouds in the ether above. 
Everpresent states of mind from which the soul stems,
Seriously taken, eternally made.
